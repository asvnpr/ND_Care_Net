Annually, Indiana 211 reaches out to service providers to verify the accuracy of database records. Due to the overwhelming capacity requirements of this approach, over 1,100 organization updates are past due as of May 2019, and the oldest outdated record should have been updated in May 2018. Generally, accounts are expected to be removed if an organization does not respond within 90 days of missing the database record verification. However, Indiana 211 often keeps records active despite the lack of verification based on the importance of the services or the assumption that services are continued. This approach has lead to an abundance of obsolete and inaccurate data, wasting time and resources for populations in need and those who support them. This problem is compounded for those with complex needs that demand multiple services from various providers or for populations where the service network is highly informal and consisting of activists and volunteers. \n","\n","Nonetheless, identifying and accessing social services is critical in aiding vulnerable individuals and families in their move toward self-sufficiency; this is particularly true for individuals new to negotiating networks of services, including first-time domestic abuse victims, the recently unemployed, or the formerly incarcerated. This pilot project seeks to answer the question: How do you efficiently and effectively connect p\n","eople in need, as well as those helping them, to services and resources (informal and formal) available in a community that is continuously changing?\n","\n","## Initial Data Exploration\n","\n","Our dataset is very limited particularly in the short description that could be used to compare and differentiate different **Programs** and their **Providers**. This may mean that some Data Mining or Web Scraping is required. First, we explore what data we have availabe if that were the case\n","\n","## Data Integration, Refactoring, and Save"]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"-WzXZ2xACI74","colab_type":"code","outputId":"a5426dad-6893-4ff7-b29a-4f8fe7987636","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1581210032095,"user_tz":300,"elapsed":4624,"user":{"displayName":"Alejandro Vega-Nogales","photoUrl":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/AAuE7mC-GSJ1wzaV5zQOywpB-McsvDSg-CmJGVIcovQn=s64","userId":"06234555604493977329"}},"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":127}},"source":["from google.colab import drive\n","drive.mount('/content/drive/')\n","prefix = './drive/My Drive/ND_CSE/Year_1/Research:Care-Net/code_and_data'\n","!ls"],"execution_count":0,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","text":["Drive already mounted at /content/drive/;
