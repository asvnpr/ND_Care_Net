If all four cores run at the full speed, the processor consumes 2 Watts (W) (0.5 W for each core). If a core is put into sleep, the leakage power of the core is 10% of its dynamic power. If the entire processor is put to sleep, the leakage is 15% of the total dynamic power. Assume that the application is fully parallelizable.\n",

The hardware design group estimates it can speed up the encryption hardware even more with significant additional investment. You wonder whether adding a second unit in order to support parallel encryption operations would be more useful. Imagine that in the original program 90% of the encryption operations could be performed in parallel. What is the speedup of providing two or four encryption units, assuming that the parallelization allowed is limited to the number of encryption units?\n",

The new encryption engine achieves a total of 2X improvement over the original encryption engine. However, in the redesigned implementation, the new encryption engine can only be used 80% of the time, while the rest of the computation is unchanged.
